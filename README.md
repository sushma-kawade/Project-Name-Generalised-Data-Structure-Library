# Project-Name: Generalised-Data-Structure-Library
# Technology: C ++
# Description:
          • This Project is considered to be a library that contains generic implementations of all major types of data structures.
          • We provide the readymade implementation of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, and non-linear data structures in an                  object-oriented way.
          • We provide a generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any type of data type.
          • All the object-oriented design policies are used in this project
